{-
A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. 
We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if a longer common substring of the 
collection does not exist. For example, CG is a common substring of ACGTACGT and AACCGGTATA, 
whereas GTA is a longest common substring. Note that multiple longest common substrings may exist.

Given: A collection of k DNA strings (of length at most 1 kbp each; kâ‰¤100).

Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
